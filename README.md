# OOP Pattern Templates
Theese templates are originaly created by [WDS]('https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevSimplified') over at youtube.

the main diference is that i have tried to use a more descriptive naming convention (ref: singelton) in an atempt to 
make the file hirarcy more transperent and self evident.
